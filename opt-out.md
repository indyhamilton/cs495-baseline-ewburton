# Opt-Out Statement
-I decided not to complete the tasks in step 3 option 2 for this assignment.
-The part that feels overwhelming to me right now is coding in python as my previous classes were all in Java and my job during the summer was teaching Java course. 
-However, I am a TA in a class that is using Python so that I can learn to use it as well as Java. This will enable me to learn the language and build confidence.
